# Inflaid — Project Overview

**Inflaid** is a SaaS tool that helps beauty & skincare brands vet Instagram influencers before spending budget on collaborations. A brand enters any Instagram handle, the system pulls live data, scores the account across 7 ROI factors, and outputs a structured decision: verdict, campaign type, budget estimate, ROI forecast, and a personalized outreach message.

**Honest positioning:** Inflaid is a fast screening tool — it helps brands eliminate bad choices quickly and understand a profile's basics. It is NOT a precise ROI oracle. Scores indicate direction, not exact value. Best accuracy range: **10K–500K followers**.

## Backend

### Authentication
All protected endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Token is a Supabase JWT verified via `sb.auth.get_user(token)`.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/score` | ✅ | Analyze an Instagram handle |
| POST | `/outreach` | ✅ | Generate AI outreach message (Claude Haiku) |
| POST | `/create-checkout` | ✅ | Create Lemon Squeezy checkout |
| POST | `/customer-portal` | ✅ | Open Lemon Squeezy customer portal |
| POST | `/webhook` | Lemon sig | Handle Lemon Squeezy payment events |
| POST | `/campaign/create` | ✅ | Log a new campaign (spend tier + outcome) |
| GET | `/campaigns` | ✅ | List user's logged campaigns |
| POST | `/campaign/{id}/result` | ✅ | Update campaign with orders/notes |
| POST | `/referral/apply` | ❌ | Apply referral code (+5/+2 analyses) |
| GET | `/public/profile/{handle}` | ❌ | Public cached score (no auth) |
| GET | `/health` | ❌ | Health check |

### `/score` Flow
1. Verify JWT → get email
2. Look up user in `users` table — create on first use (plan: free, limit: 2)
3. Check `analyses_used >= analyses_limit` → 429 if over limit
4. Check Supabase `analyses` cache (7-day TTL) — return if found
5. Call Apify → fetch last 20 **feed posts**, follower count, engagement
6. Run 7-factor scorer → compute final score
7. Run verdict engine → campaign type, budget, risk, action items
8. Run ROI estimator → reach, conversion, revenue projection
9. Save to cache, increment usage counter
10. Return full `ScoreResponse`

### Scoring System

**Formula:** `score = round(weighted_sum × fraud_multiplier)`

| Factor | Weight | What it measures | Reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engagement Quality | 30% | Like/comment ratio vs follower count, tier-adjusted | Medium |
| Content Rhythm | 20% | Feed post interval consistency | Low (see known issues) |
| Audience Reliability | 20% | Follower/following ratio, engagement vs expectation | Medium |
| Niche Depth | 15% | Beauty keyword coverage in captions + hashtags | Good |
| Authenticity | 10% | Sponsored signal ratio, engagement spike detection | Medium |
| Growth Momentum | 5% | Recent vs older post engagement | Low |
| Fraud Multiplier | modifier | Ghost follower signals, engagement spikes | Medium |

**Labels:** `elite` (85+) · `high` (70+) · `mid` (50+) · `risky` (30+) · `avoid` (<30)

**Optimal range: 10K–500K followers.** This is stated on the landing page as positioning, not disclaimer.

### Known Scoring Limitations

1. **Scraper only gets feed posts.** Instagram Reels and Stories are not scraped. Large accounts (100K+) that primarily post Reels will show 30+ day feed intervals → rhythm score returns neutral 50 instead of penalizing.

2. **Instagram hides likes on large accounts.** When `likesCount = 0`, fraud detector uses comment-only threshold instead of full engagement threshold.

3. **Weights are not data-validated.** The 30/20/20/15/10/5 split was designed by intuition. No real campaign outcome data has been used to validate these weights yet. Campaign Tracker will eventually fix this.

4. **ROI estimates are heuristic.** Revenue = conversions × AOV ($45 default). Conversions are estimated from engagement rate tiers, not real data. Show confidence levels honestly.

5. **Macro/mega influencers (500K+) are unreliable.** Engagement rate naturally drops at scale. Tier-based multipliers partially compensate but not fully validated.

6. **Tier multipliers (engagement.py):**
   - 5M+: ×80
   - 1M–5M: ×58
   - 500K–1M: ×52
   - 100K–500K: ×42
   - 10K–100K: ×22
   - <10K: ×12

   These were set by calibrating against industry-average ER benchmarks, not real campaign data.

### Plan Limits

| Plan | Analyses/month |
|---|---|

### Supabase Tables

**`users`**
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid | |
| email | text | |
| plan | text | free / starter / growth / pro |
| analyses_used | int4 | Incremented on each analysis |
| analyses_limit | int4 | Set by plan |
| created_at | timestamp | |

**`analyses`**
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid | |
| handle | text | Instagram handle |
| score | int4 | |
| label | text | elite/high/mid/risky/avoid |
| result | jsonb | Full ScoreResponse JSON |
| created_at | timestamp | Cache TTL: 7 days |

**`campaigns`** *(must be created manually in Supabase)*
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid | |
| user_email | text | |
| handle | text | |
| spend_tier | text | gifted / under100 / 100-500 / 500-2k / 2k+ |
| outcome | text | worth_it / meh / waste |
| campaign_date | date | |
| orders_range | text | 0 / 1-5 / 5-20 / 20+ (optional, added later) |
| notes | text | optional |
| status | text | logged / completed |
| created_at | timestamptz | |

**RLS: disabled on all tables.** Backend uses service_role key (bypasses RLS). Frontend never queries tables directly. Anon key IS exposed in frontend JS — acceptable risk since anon key is read-only and tables are not directly queryable without RLS policies.

---

## Campaign Tracker

### Status: Frontend + Backend built. Supabase table needs manual creation.

### Purpose
Close the feedback loop: users log campaign outcomes → system eventually learns what actually works.

### Current implementation
- **Frontend (dashboard.html):** 3-field form (handle, spend tier, outcome). Data saved to localStorage. Badge shows campaign count.
- **Backend (main.py):** `/campaign/create`, `/campaigns`, `/campaign/{id}/result` endpoints — ready but localStorage is used for now.
- **Not yet wired:** frontend doesn't call backend campaign endpoints yet. Uses localStorage only. Cross-device sync for campaigns not implemented.

### Future: Feedback Loop
When enough campaign data exists (target: 50+ campaigns):
- campaigns table → aggregate by follower_tier + outcome
- Update `roi_calibration` table with real ROAS data
- Show "calibrated from X real campaigns" badge on ROI estimates
- This is the moat: real outcome data that competitors don't have

---

## Payments

Currently **Lemon Squeezy**.

**Lemon Squeezy flow:**
1. User clicks upgrade → `POST /create-checkout` with plan + JWT
2. Backend creates Lemon Squeezy checkout URL
3. User pays → Lemon Squeezy webhook fires
4. Backend updates `users` table: plan + analyses_limit
5. Redirect to `/dashboard.html?upgraded=1`

## Positioning

| What Inflaid IS | What Inflaid is NOT |
|---|---|
| Fast screening tool | Precise ROI oracle |
| Decision helper (Gift/Paid/Avoid) | Replacement for human judgment |
| Best for 10K–500K creators | Reliable for 500K+ accounts |
| Outreach generator | Campaign management platform |
| Early feedback tracker | Validated ML model |

## Known Issues / To-Do

### Blocking (must fix before launch)
- [ ] **Domain** — still on `vettly-eight.vercel.app` / `vettly-production-63d5.up.railway.app`. After purchase: update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway + Supabase Auth URLs (Site URL + Redirect URLs)
- [x] **LemonSqueezy** — checkout, portal, webhook flow moved off Stripe
- [ ] **`campaigns` Supabase table** — must be created manually (SQL in this file above)
- [ ] **Rename infrastructure** — repo name, Vercel project, Railway project still say "vettly"

### Important (pre-growth)
- [ ] **`analyses` table has no `user_email` column** — Supabase history sync fetches all public analyses, not per-user. Add `user_email` column and filter by it in `syncHistoryFromSupabase()`
- [ ] **Campaign tracker not wired to backend** — currently localStorage only. Wire `/campaign/create` call when user saves a campaign
- [ ] **OG image** — `og-image.png` referenced in meta tags but doesn't exist
- [ ] **Mobile polish** — fixed across all pages but may need additional review on real devices

### Future / Growth
- [ ] **ROI calibration from real campaigns** — when 50+ campaigns logged, build `roi_calibration` table and feed real ROAS into estimates
- [ ] **Email reminders** — "How did @handle go? (2 clicks)" 7 days after campaign log
- [ ] **Per-user analysis history** — requires `user_email` column in `analyses` table
- [ ] **Fashion / food / fitness categories** — `categories/config.py` has placeholder entries, just needs keywords
- [ ] **Admin panel** — no visibility into failed scrapes or usage stats
- [ ] **Confidence scoring UI** — backend can compute data confidence level; not yet shown in UI
- [ ] **Team seats** — Pro plan mentions team seats but not implemented
